I have learned CSS components, such as buttons, forms, and navigation bars, are modular elements in web design used for styling and structuring user interfaces. They enhance visual consistency and user experience by providing a standardized and reusable approach to styling webpage elements.
I have learned that In HTML and CSS, your first comment can be written using <!-- Your comment here --> to add explanatory notes in your code. For an element selector, if you want to style a specific HTML element, you can use its name preceded by a period (.) for classes or a hash (#) for IDs in your CSS file, like ".my-class" or "#my-id".
